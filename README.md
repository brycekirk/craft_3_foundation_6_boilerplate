## Start developing

* Run `gulp watch` from your project directory to watch for changes to `assets/js/src/scripts.js` and `assets/scss/styles.scss`

##  More info
* `config/project.yaml` will generate some initial fields: `body`, `image`, `defaultMetaDescription` and `defaultSocialImage`, a homepage entry and an images asset volume located at `assets/uploads/img`
* If you want to stop using a project config file, delete `project.yaml` and the `'useProjectConfigFile' => true,` line from `config/general`
* By default, all of foundation.js is included. You can change this by removing the `'bower_components/foundation-sites/dist/js/foundation.min.js',` line from `gulpfile.js` and manually adding the paths to specific Javascript plugins from `bower_components/foundation-sites/dist/js/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME.js`
